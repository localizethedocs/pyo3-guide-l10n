"Rust and Python have very different notions of memory management.  Rust has "
"a strict memory model with concepts of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, "
"where memory is freed at predictable points in program execution.  Python "
"has a looser memory model in which variables are reference-counted with "
"shared, mutable state by default. A global interpreter lock (GIL) is needed "
"to prevent race conditions, and a garbage collector is needed to break "
"reference cycles. Memory in Python is freed eventually by the garbage "
"collector, but not usually in a predictable way."

"PyO3 bridges the Rust and Python memory models with two different strategies "
"for accessing memory allocated on Python's heap from inside Rust.  These are "
"GIL-bound, or \"owned\" references, and GIL-independent `Py<Any>` smart "

"PyO3's GIL-bound, \"owned references\" (`&PyAny` etc.) make PyO3 more "

"assume the GIL is held. (If PyO3 could not assume this, every PyO3 API would "
"need to take a `Python` GIL token to prove that the GIL is held.)  This "

"`acquire_gil()` is dropped, the `GILPool` is also dropped and the Python "
