"This section of the guide briefly discusses how to connect the two "
"languages' logging ecosystems together. The recommended way for Python "
"extension modules is to configure Rust's logger to send log messages to "
"Python using the `pyo3-log` crate. For users who want to do the opposite and "
"send Python log messages to Rust, see the note at the end of this guide."
