"The C API is naturally unsafe and requires you to manage reference counts, "
"errors and specific invariants yourself. Please refer to the [C API "
"Reference Manual](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/) and [The Rustonomicon]"
"(https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/ffi.html) before using any "
"function from that API."

msgid ""
"PyO3's \"owned references\" (`&PyAny` etc.) make PyO3 more ergonomic to use "
"by ensuring that their lifetime can never be longer than the duration the "
"Python GIL is held. This means that most of PyO3's API can assume the GIL is "
"held. (If PyO3 could not assume this, every PyO3 API would need to take a "
"`Python` GIL token to prove that the GIL is held.)"
msgstr ""

#: src/advanced.md:13
msgid ""
"The caveat to these \"owned references\" is that Rust references do not "
"normally convey ownership (they are always `Copy`, and cannot implement "
"`Drop`). Whenever a PyO3 API returns an owned reference, PyO3 stores it "
"internally, so that PyO3 can decrease the reference count just before PyO3 "
"releases the GIL."

#: src/advanced.md:15
msgid ""
"For most use cases this behaviour is invisible. Occasionally, however, users "
"may need to clear memory usage sooner than PyO3 usually does. PyO3 exposes "
"this functionality with the  the `GILPool` struct. When a `GILPool` is "
"dropped, _**all**_ owned references created after the `GILPool` was created "
"will be cleared."

#: src/advanced.md:17
msgid ""
"The unsafe function `Python::new_pool` allows you to create a new `GILPool`. "
"When doing this, you must be very careful to ensure that once the `GILPool` "
"is dropped you do not retain access any owned references created after the "
"`GILPool` was created."
