"While rust-cpython has a macro based dsl for declaring modules and classes, "
"PyO3 use proc macros and specialization. PyO3 also doesn't change your "
"struct and functions so you can still use them as normal rust functions. The "
"disadvantage is that proc macros and specialization currently only work on "
"nightly."
