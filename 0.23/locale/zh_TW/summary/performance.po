"Pythonic API implemented using PyO3 are often polymorphic, i.e. they will "
"accept `&Bound<'_, PyAny>` and try to turn this into multiple more concrete "
"types to which the requested operation is applied. This often leads to "
"chains of calls to `extract`, e.g."

"This suboptimal as the `FromPyObject<T>` trait requires `extract` to have a "
"`Result<T, PyErr>` return type. For native types like `PyList`, it faster to "
"use `downcast` (which `extract` calls internally) when the error value is "
"ignored. This avoids the costly conversion of a `PyDowncastError` to a "
"`PyErr` required to fulfil the `FromPyObject` contract, i.e."

"PyO3 uses global mutable state to keep track of deferred reference count "
"updates implied by `impl<T> Drop for Py<T>` being called without the GIL "
"being held. The necessary synchronization to obtain and apply these "
"reference count updates when PyO3-based code next acquires the GIL is "
"somewhat expensive and can become a significant part of the cost of crossing "
"the Python-Rust boundary."

"This functionality can be avoided by setting the "
"`pyo3_disable_reference_pool` conditional compilation flag. This removes the "
"global reference pool and the associated costs completely. However, it does "
"_not_ remove the `Drop` implementation for `Py<T>` which is necessary to "
"interoperate with existing Rust code written without PyO3-based code in "
"mind. To stay compatible with the wider Rust ecosystem in these cases, we "
"keep the implementation but abort when `Drop` is called without the GIL "
"being held. If `pyo3_leak_on_drop_without_reference_pool` is additionally "
"enabled, objects dropped without the GIL being held will be leaked instead "
"which is always sound but might have determinal effects like resource "
"exhaustion in the long term."

"making sure to re-acquire the GIL beforehand. For example, the following code"
