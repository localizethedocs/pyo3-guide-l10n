"If you have a static function, you can expose it with `#[pyfunction]` and "

"pyo3/latest/pyo3/struct.PyObject.html). For dynamic functions, e.g. lambdas "
"and functions that were passed as arguments, you must put them in some kind "
"of owned container, e.g. a `Box`. (A long-term solution will be a special "
"container similar to wasm-bindgen's `Closure`). You can then use a "
"`#[pyclass]` struct with that container as a field as a way to pass the "
"function over the FFI barrier. You can even make that class callable with "
"`__call__` so it looks like a function in Python code."
