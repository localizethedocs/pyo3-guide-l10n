"If you are working with a Python library that makes use of async functions "
"or wish to provide Python bindings for an async Rust library, [`pyo3-async-"
"runtimes`](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3-async-runtimes) likely has the tools "
"you need. It provides conversions between async functions in both Python and "
"Rust and was designed with first-class support for popular Rust runtimes "
"such as [`tokio`](https://tokio.rs/) and [`async-std`](https://async.rs/). "
"In addition, all async Python code runs on the default `asyncio` event loop, "
"so `pyo3-async-runtimes` should work just fine with existing Python "
"libraries."

"Managing event loop references can be tricky with `pyo3-async-runtimes`. See "
"[Event Loop References](https://docs.rs/pyo3-async-runtimes/#event-loop-"

"how event loop references are managed in this library."

"Testing `pyo3-async-runtimes` libraries and applications requires a custom "
