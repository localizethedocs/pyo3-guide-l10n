"PyO3 provides a struct [`GILOnceCell`](https://pyo3.rs/main/doc/pyo3/sync/"
"struct.GILOnceCell.html) which implements a single-initialization API based "
"on these types that relies on the GIL for locking. If the GIL is released or "
"there is no GIL, then this type allows the initialization function to race "
"but ensures that the data is only ever initialized once. If you need to "
"ensure that the initialization function is called once and only once, you "
"can make use of the [`OnceExt`](https://pyo3.rs/main/doc/pyo3/sync/trait."
"OnceExt.html) and [`OnceLockExt`](https://pyo3.rs/main/doc/pyo3/sync/trait."
"OnceLockExt.html) extension traits that enable using the standard library "
"types for this purpose but provide new methods for these types that avoid "
"the risk of deadlocking with the Python GIL. This means they can be used in "
"place of other choices when you are experiencing the deadlock described "
"above. See the documentation for [`GILOnceCell`](https://pyo3.rs/main/doc/"
"pyo3/sync/struct.GILOnceCell.html) and [`OnceExt`](https://pyo3.rs/main/doc/"
