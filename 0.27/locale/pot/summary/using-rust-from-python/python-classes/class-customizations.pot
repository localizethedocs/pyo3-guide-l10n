"If your type owns references to other Python objects, you will need to "
"integrate with Python's garbage collector so that the GC is aware of those "
"references.  To do this, implement the two methods `__traverse__` and "
"`__clear__`.  These correspond to the slots `tp_traverse` and `tp_clear` in "
"the Python C API. `__traverse__` must call `visit.call()` for each reference "
"to another Python object.  `__clear__` must clear out any mutable references "
"to other Python objects (thus breaking reference cycles). Immutable "
"references do not have to be cleared, as every cycle must contain at least "
"one mutable reference."
