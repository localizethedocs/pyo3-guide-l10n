"There are two way to distribute your module as python package: The old "
"[setuptools-rust](https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust) and the new [pyo3-"
"pack](https://github.com/pyo3/pyo3-pack). setuptools-rust needs some "
"configuration files (`setup.py`,  `MANIFEST.in`, `build-wheels.sh`, etc.) "
"and external tools (docker, twine). pyo3-pack doesn't need any configuration "
"files. It can not yet build sdist though ([pyo3/pyo3-pack#2](https://github."
"com/PyO3/pyo3-pack/issues/2))."
