"When building, you can set `PYTHON_SYS_EXECUTABLE` to the python interpreter "
"that pyo3 should be linked to. You might need to set the `python2` or "
"`python3` feature accordingly. On linux/mac you might have to change "
"`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include libpython, while on windows you might need to "
"set `LIB` to include `pythonxy.lib` (where x and y are major and minor "
"version), which is normally either in the `libs` or `Lib` folder of a python "
"installation. Also make sure that python is in `PATH` when you're not using  "
"`PYTHON_SYS_EXECUTABLE`."
