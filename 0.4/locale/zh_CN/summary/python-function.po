"put them in some kind of owned container, e.g. a box. (Long-Term a special "
"container similar to wasm-bindgen's `Closure` should take care of that). You "
"can than use a `#[pyclass]` struct with that container as field as a way to "
"pass the function over the ffi-barrier. You can even make that class "
"callable with `__call__` so it looks like a function in python code."
