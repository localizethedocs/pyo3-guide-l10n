"The C API is naturally unsafe and requires you to manage reference counts, "
"errors and specific invariants yourself. Please refer to the [C API "
"Reference Manual](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/) and [The Rustonomicon]"
"(https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/ffi.html) before using any "

"PyO3's `&PyAny` \"owned references\" and `Py<PyAny>` smart pointers are used "
"to access memory stored in Python's heap.  This memory sometimes lives for "
"longer than expected because of differences in Rust and Python's memory "
"models.  See the chapter on [memory management](./memory.md) for more "
"information."
