#: src/python-from-rust.md:15
msgid ""
"To safely interact with the Python interpreter a Rust thread must have a "
"corresponding Python thread state and hold the [Global Interpreter Lock "
"(GIL)](#the-global-interpreter-lock). PyO3 has a `Python<'py>` token that is "
"used to prove that these conditions are met. Its lifetime `'py` is a central "
"part of PyO3's API."

"It provides global APIs for the Python interpreter, such as [`py.eval()`]"

"Its lifetime `'py` is used to bind many of PyO3's types to the Python "

msgstr ""

#: src/python-from-rust.md:24
msgid ""
"PyO3's types that are bound to the `'py` lifetime, for example `Bound<'py, "

msgid "The Global Interpreter Lock"
msgstr ""

#: src/python-from-rust.md:30
msgid ""
"Concurrent programming in Python is aided by the Global Interpreter Lock "
"(GIL), which ensures that only one Python thread can use the Python "
"interpreter and its API at the same time. This allows it to be used to "
"synchronize code. See the [`pyo3::sync`](https://pyo3.rs/main/doc/pyo3/sync/"
"index.html) module for synchronization tools PyO3 offers that are based on "
"the GIL's guarantees."

#: src/python-from-rust.md:32

"Non-Python operations (system calls and native Rust code) can unlock the "
"GIL. See [the section on parallelism](parallelism.md) for how to do that "

msgid "Python's memory model differs from Rust's memory model in two key ways:"
msgstr ""

#: src/python-from-rust.md:37
msgid ""
"There is no concept of ownership; all Python objects are shared and usually "
"implemented via reference counting"
msgstr ""

#: src/python-from-rust.md:38
msgid ""
"There is no concept of exclusive (`&mut`) references; any reference can "
"mutate a Python object"
msgstr ""

#: src/python-from-rust.md:40
msgid ""
"PyO3's API reflects this by providing [smart pointer](https://doc.rust-lang."
"org/book/ch15-00-smart-pointers.html) types, `Py<T>`, `Bound<'py, T>`, and "
"(the very rarely used) `Borrowed<'a, 'py, T>`. These smart pointers all use "
"Python reference counting. See the [subchapter on types](./types.md) for "
"more detail on these types."
msgstr ""

#: src/python-from-rust.md:42
msgid ""
"Because of the lack of exclusive `&mut` references, PyO3's APIs for Python "
"objects, for example \\[`PyListMethods::append`\\], use shared references. "
"This is safe because Python objects have internal mechanisms to prevent data "
"races (as of time of writing, the Python GIL)."
