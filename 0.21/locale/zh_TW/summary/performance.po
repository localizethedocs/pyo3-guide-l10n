"Pythonic API implemented using PyO3 are often polymorphic, i.e. they will "

"types to which the requested operation is applied. This often leads to "
"chains of calls to `extract`, e.g."

"使用 PyO3 實作的 Python 風格 API 通常是多型的，也就是接受 `&Bound<'_, "

"This suboptimal as the `FromPyObject<T>` trait requires `extract` to have a "
"`Result<T, PyErr>` return type. For native types like `PyList`, it faster to "
"use `downcast` (which `extract` calls internally) when the error value is "

"Calling `Python::with_gil` is effectively a no-op when the GIL is already "
"held, but checking that this is the case still has a cost. If an existing "
"GIL token can not be accessed, for example when implementing a pre-existing "
"trait, but a GIL-bound reference is available, this cost can be avoided by "
"exploiting that access to GIL-bound reference gives zero-cost access to a "
